# Thinkful Coding Challenge

Hi! Thanks for reviewing my code.


## Assumptions

* We should not install / use any packages not included in the original package.json files (no moment.js, redux, etc).
* Generally prioritized readability over efficiency given size of data, but noted where this could be changed.
* The error message can simply be some red text displayed under the form (design preference, could do a modal).
* The data from the public endpoint could be updated at any time.
